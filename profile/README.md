The following tools are developed and mantained by the F4E neutronics team:

- [F4Enix](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/F4Enix) a python package that helps to pre and post process many different inputs and outputs related to neutronic analyses.
- [F4E_radwaste](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/F4E_radwaste), a program to define and analyze radwaste packages via a fine 3D mesh superimposed to the geometry of a Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation.
- [SCtools](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/SCtools), a package grouping a set of useful IronPython routines to manipulate/analyse/modify CAD files in SpaceClaim environment.
- [DoseMap-calculator](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/DoseMap-calculator), a practical tool to obtain doses of a component travelling through a radiation field.
- [iMCNP_Source](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/iMCNP_Source), a script that creates a complete MCNP sdef card for a set of pipes containing activated water.
