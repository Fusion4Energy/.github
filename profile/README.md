# Fusion For Energy
Welcome to Fusion For Energy GitHub organization. Below, you can find details on the different repositories hosted here.

## Neutronics

The following tools are developed and mantained by the F4E neutronics team:

- [F4Enix](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/F4Enix) a python package that helps to pre and post process many different inputs and outputs related to neutronic analyses.
- [F4E_radwaste](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/F4E_radwaste), a program to define and analyze radwaste packages via a fine 3D mesh superimposed to the geometry of a Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation.
- [F4Epurity](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/F4Epurity), a python-based tool that can be used to approximate the change in activity and dose resulting from a deviation in chemical composition of a material under irradiation
- [RadModeling](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/RadModeling), a package grouping a set of useful IronPython routines to manipulate/analyse/modify CAD files in SpaceClaim environment.
- [DoseMap-calculator](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/DoseMap-calculator), a practical tool to obtain doses of a component travelling through a radiation field.
- [iMCNP_Source](https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/iMCNP_Source), a script that creates a complete MCNP sdef card for a set of pipes containing activated water.

F4E neutronics team is also one of the main contributors to other two projects that have their own independent GitHub organizations:
- [JADE](https://github.com/JADE-V-V) which is related to the verification and validation (V&V) of nuclear data libraries.
- [GEOUNED](https://github.com/GEOUNED-org/GEOUNED) which is related to conversion from CAD to CSG geometry (and viceversa) for Monte Carlo transport application.
